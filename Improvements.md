1. The icons are still not working... if you need to convert the SVGs first, do so
2. on the auto rotate wheel... only auto-rotate when user has picked an ingredient in the segment - do this order: 1) Base, 2) Fresh, 3) Aroma, 4) Oil, 5) Umami, 6) Sour, 7) Sweet, 8) Crunch... and then let run free (user can pick more as they please)
3. Make a proper food pairing engine that actually proposes ingredients based on what's been chosen in the past.
4. It is still recommending a lot of ingredients that have already been chosen, like it goes crazy on noodles, for example. Please make 100% sure that it doesn't recommend ingredients that have already been chosen 
5. Make a proper common versus exotic ingredients tag so it ensures, at onset, only to propose the common ingredients - most commonly used in Europe (based on the CD Common_Danish variable in ![[CommonIngredients.xlsx]])
6. Have a proper dish pairing algorithm that proposes dishes that are more common, not sweet but dinner kind of dishes.
7. Also add better filters, particularly the nutritional and the regional tags
